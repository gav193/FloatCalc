"Floating Point Calculator" with VHDL and implemented into a FPGA Board and simulated with Altera
Quartus and ModelSIM with a boundary of "ab.cd () ef.gh = ...."

---

# This floating point calculator uses several methods in calculating with 3 main functions : 
* Addition : BCD and correction on each 2 digits above and below the decimal point
* Subtraction : Integer conversion and correction on each digit (to check for borrowed digits)
* Multiplication : Integer conversion and modulus to check for increments (to check for carry-on digits)
